Loving-Kindness Meditation: Aims to cultivate compassion and positive emotions towards oneself and others by silently repeating phrases that express goodwill.
Body Scan Meditation: Involves paying attention to different parts of the body, often starting from the toes and working up to the head, to increase body awareness and relaxation.

How to Get Started

Choose a Quiet Space: Find a comfortable and quiet place where you won’t be disturbed.
